          <h2>Hi! I'm Matt!</h2>
          <p>I'm a healthcare consultant turned software developer based in Philadelphia. After many years focusing
            my career efforts on optimizing revenue cycle management for healthcare providers, I've decided that I'm
            able to be more impactful with the addition of a new skill -- web development. </p>

          <p>In the United States' healthcare system, any process that saves time is also one that reduces costs.
            Leveraging my
            knowledge of provider operations, I help streamline operations through the use of
            technology solutions.</p>

        <h2>About Matt</h2>
        <div class='group'>
          <div class='item'>
            <p>Functioning as an advisor to healthcare providers, I've learned the importance of having a
              collaborative approach to solving
              business problems. This is a skill that's transferrable to the world of software development and I hope
              that my past expierence will help fasttrack my career in the tech. I love to learn and share my
              knowledge with peers and help solve a common problem.</p>
            <p> Helping others recieve
              the behavioral health care they desperately need is still something I'm passionate about. With my newfound
              love of web development, I'm able to help healthcare providers:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Optimize Utilization Review departments by implementing orizational tools to help manage day-to-day
                operations.</li>
              <li>Improve health outcomes by identifying patients' barriers to lower levels of care.</li>
              <li>Idenify outstanding insurance claims for resubmission and reimbursement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My ultimate goal is to
              eventual fuse my newly developed engineering knowledge to provide solutions in the healthcare space,
              specifically when it comes to payer relations and revenue cycle management. These might sounds like lofty plans but I know with the help of other like-minded developers, we can work together to make them a reality!</p>

            <p>When I'm not learning to code or working as a healthcare consultant, you can find me at the dog park with
              my pup, Marla, or working on some new music! I'm excited to meet and work with other developers and
              continue learning!

          <h3>Prep Course Assignment</h3>
          <p>Here's a link to the portfolio website that I built as part of the Thinkful Prep Course. It's a very basic
            HTML and CSS webpage. This was before I
            learned about responsive layouts and flexbox! I look forward to continue learing!</p>
